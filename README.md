# InformationForge - a Information Theory Calculator

InformationForge is a toolkit rooted in Information Theory, providing essential functionalities for analyzing information sources, quantifying information in bits, and modeling communication channels.

InformationForge computes entropy for a wide array of data sources, encompassing those modeled by both Shannon and Markov processes.
Moreover, it facilitates the measurement of information content in bits, enabling users to precisely quantify and compare information across different sources.
